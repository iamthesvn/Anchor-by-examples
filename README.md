# Anchor-by-examples

This repository was created as a personal learning resource while exploring the Solana Anchor framework. The examples in this repository are from the official Anchor examples page: [https://examples.anchor-lang.com/](https://examples.anchor-lang.com/).

## Why this repo exists

- By working through these examples, I learn the structure and development lifecycle of Anchor-based Solana programs.
- Practicing with Anchor commands helps me become comfortable with the Anchor CLI and its workflows.
- Exploring real-world Anchor program layouts and best practices.
- By uploading these projects to GitHub, I also become more familiar with version control systems and best practices for managing codebases.

## What you'll find here
- Example Solana programs written in Rust using Anchor
- Anchor project structure and configuration files
- Test scripts and deployment recipes

## Credits
